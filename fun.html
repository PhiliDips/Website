        <h3>Robert Street</h3>

        <p>This drink was created by myself and a friend of mine in an apartment on Robert Street, Toronto. It is a variation of the White Russian using chocolate milk instead of the usual cream.
            <br>Fun fact: the first iteration of this cocktail (which has been posthumously dubbed the "Dirty Saito") used Yoo-hoo chocolate beverage instead of actual chocolate milk.
            I can't recommend you try the Dirty Saito, but the Robert Street can be quite delicious after a long day.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 oz coffee liqueur</li>
            <li>1 oz vodka</li>
            <li>4 oz 1% chocolate milk</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Stir to combine and serve straight up in a chilled rocks glass. Optionally garnish with a cocoa powder rim.</p>

        <p>As a bartender, part of my job is to create exciting new drinks to shake up the menu of my venue. After a couple of months on the job at the Rosedale Golf Club,
            I found myself bored with the tequila sodas and the scotch and waters. I wanted to introduce the gentlemen of the Club to a properly sweet, fruity, effeminate,
            hangover-inducing cocktails.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 oz white rum</li>
            <li>2 oz lemonade</li>
            <li>2 oz cranberry juice</li>
            <li>2 oz orange juice</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Shake and serve on the rocks. Garnish with lime and a skewed cherry.</p>
